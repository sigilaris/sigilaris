Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, our
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.
